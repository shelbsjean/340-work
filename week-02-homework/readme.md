# Shelby Swanson 50

1. I installed and learned all the new programs introduced this week which includes: Github, SourceTree, Git, and Atom. I took each program through the step by step process laid out on the class website. 

2. I googled many questions in order to do my homework correctly. I also watch the videos provided and also just did some playing around with the programs in order to solve issues and complete the tasks presented. 

3. I had the most issues with SourceTree and trying to connect it to my repo in Github. I also found the Git command system to be confusing at first but I got the hang of it as I continued to work with it. I didn't post my issue in the repo tracker because I forgot that was a helpful source available to me. I will for sure use it in the next assignments and following weeks to get the help I need. I found [this website](https://people.rit.edu/~jac3160/230/project1/repo.html) to be very helpful when I ran into issues.

4. I learned that this class is gonna be a challenge for me because it is such a different way of thinking for me. I am willing to put in more time and effort in the class in order to be successful.

5. I procrastinated on this cycle of homework and there for was unable to help fellow classmates and discuss issues and triumphs with them. I will for sure complete and work on next weeks cycle earlier so that I can engage in discussions with classmates.
