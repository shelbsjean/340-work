1. This week I learned about how to better your layout when using CSS coding.
Also how to ad boarders and boxes to your text to create emphasis or a
design element. I really enjoyed seeing how much more you can do with the CSS.
I'm really enjoying the design and layout part of this class.

2. I had issues this week making my thoughts in my head workout on the screen.
I am not super proud of what I turned in this week but I will learn from my
 mistakes and do better with CSS next week. My format wasn't doing what I thought
 I coded it to do so I'll have to take so time and go back and see where I went
 wrong.

 3. This wasn't my best week. I had issues making my vison into reality. I am
disappointed with my performance this week but I will stay positive and just work
harder next week! I struggle and had a time crunch this week and was unable to
get my project where I wanted it to be.

4. If I would have managed my time better I could have gone to the issues wiki
and maybe got my issues resolved and created a better product. I need to start
my projects sooner so I have time to get help when I need it.
