1. This week I learned about web browsers and html language and tags. This was my first interaction with html but the instructions on the course website were very helpful. Also the book provided more in depth descriptions that were helpful in my understanding this week.

2. This week I didn't run into any issues with the programs and technology. My only issues came from the concepts of browsers and the language used. To resolve these issues I turned to my book for more descriptions on the concepts and they became more clear.

3. I was proud of how quickly I picked up the language and code for this week. I became quite comfortable with the code and when it came to adding the poem to my website it went really smoothly.

4. I did get a chance to engage with other students on the issues wiki. I didn't have any issues so I just lent my advise or added my opinions where I saw fit. The wiki is definitely a valuable resource that I will continue to participate in and use when I come across issues.

5. This week got me excited about the remainder of the semester. I found the material very interesting and I look forward to learning more about the basis of websites and how to create and generate content that will be pleasing to the eye for the user.
