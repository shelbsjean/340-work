    Somebody has to go polish the stars, <br />
    They're looking a little bit dull. <br />
    Somebody has to polish the stars,<br />
    For the eagles and starlings and gulls<br />
    Have all been complaining they are tarnished
    and worn,<br /> They say they want new ones we
    cannot afford.<br />So please get your rags<br />
    And your polishing jars,<br /> Somebody has
    to polish the stars.
