1. This week I learned about CSS language and how to create a website with more
design elements. There was a lot of new code to learn and master. I never knew
so much went into the code in order to make a website look good and have a good
design to it. I really enjoyed playing with the colors and fonts for this
assignment.

2. I didn't have many issues this week once I began the project. I did go back
and change somethings once I saw my project as a website to help with the
design and overall flow. I also looked at other students projects to get a
feel for which layouts I liked best.

3. Again I am pleasantly surprised with my understanding and grasps of
these new concepts. I catch on quickly and love seeing the finished product
after completing the code and hoping it turns out right. Its a very satisfying
feeling when everything turns out like in your head. I think I am really going
to enjoy this CSS coding because I love design.

4. Seeing as I am turning my assignment in a week later, I felt that helping
others with issues would be irrelevant at this point. I will however take a look
at this weeks problems and see if I can help others understand where they went wrong
or help myself to learn something new.
