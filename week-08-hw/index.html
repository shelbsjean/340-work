  <h1 class="heading"> Montana </h1>
  <h2 class="heading2"> The 406 </h2>
  <p class="text"> Montana is known to most who live there as "the last best
     place". To me this couldn't be a more valid way to describe the state.
     Montana is full of beautiful scenery, adventure, and some of the <i>best</i>
     people I have ever come across. Mant of those who have not visted the state,
     much like myself three years ago, think only cowboys live here. I quickly
     learned that although yes many people here do own or work on a ranch or
     participate in rodeo, most are just down right good people. Montana is
     so welcoming and captivating I oftten miss it when I go home even for a
     breif period of time. <br>
     <h2 class="heading2"> Visit Montana </h2><br>
     <p class="text2"> I strongly urge everyone who has not yet been to Montana
       to come check it out. You will not be disapointed with the surroundings.
       You will see overwhelming landscapes of mountains and rivers. Majestic
       forests will captivate you as you hike through them. The fishing will
       get you hooked and want to come back for more. The wildlife will amaze you
       as it takes you back to a time before cities existed. The Montana lifestle
       will keep you relxed and excited all at the same time. I highly recommend
       planning a trip longer then a few days to come explore the wonders that
       Montana has for everyone to enjoy. </p>
