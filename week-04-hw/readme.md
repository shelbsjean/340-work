1. This week I learned more about html language and code and improved upon
previously taught skills from the week before. This week I felt more
comfortable with code and how to create and design the format of a basic
website.

2. This week again I didn't run into any issues when completing the
assignment. I used my book often to refer to the appropriate code to use.
I felt way more comfortable with the concepts and was often just typing
code on my computer without help from outside sources.

3. I was very proud with how my website turn out and how efficiently I created
it. I am really starting to like the challenge that this course provides me
with.

4. After I submit this assignment I plan to go engage with my classmates and
view some of their work and sites. I am very curious to see how everyone else
is coming along.

5. The two websites I looked at on WayBack Machine was Google (est. 1998) and
Pinterest (est. 2010). I found it very interesting how Facebook had most if not
all their screenshots in January and February. I was surprised to see that
Google hasn't changed its design very much, for example the font and
colors of Google have stayed relatively the same style. Google was just
such an innovative way to navigate the web that the design has stayed
simple to let the idea itself shine through. Pinterest on the other hand
completely changed their look once the site gained popularity. The color scheme
started off in blue hues and has transitioned to reds. Prior to popularity,
Pinterest had less categories in which to search and group pins by. Also in the
early days no content was present on the home page and now anyone will see
pins before needing to create an account.
