1. This week I learned about how to format images and forms in a website.
There was a lot of new code to learn and master. You never really think about
about what goes into making an online form or survey behind the scenes in the
code. There was a lot of shortcuts to learn in order to make the website
more user friendly, like the required feature so the user has to fill out
all need boxes before moving on.

2. I didn't have many issues this week. I did run into a small bump in the
road when I was trying to get my images to show up on my website. I referred to
my book and the related URL section for help. I had to often look at my book
and the example site for the correct code formats.

3. Again I am pleasantly surprised with my understanding and grasps of
these new concepts. I catch on quickly and love seeing the finished product
after completing the code and hoping it turns out right. Its a very satisfying
feeling when everything turns out like in your head.

4. I helped someone who was having issues with the images like I had had. I
lent my advice and hope that she figure it out. I also looked at others sites
to see what others had come up with.
